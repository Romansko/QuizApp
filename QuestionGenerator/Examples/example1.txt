What is SANITY Testing?
This testing type actually determines if a new software version is performing well enough to accept it for a major testing effort.
This is testing of general parts of developed system.

Difference between load and stress testing is:
Load test is focused on checking system behavior under heavy load to define a point of system's response time degradation/fails. Stress testing is focused on checking capability of hardware.
Load test is focused on checking system behavior under heavy load to define a point of Database's response time degradation/fails. Stress testing is focused on checking capability of databases.
Load test checks capability of computer resources but stress test examines maximal load of the system.
No difference between these types of testing. Both them are performance testing.
Load test is focused on checking system behavior under heavy load to define a point of system's response time degradation/fails. Stress testing is focused on checking capability of hardware.

Validation and Verification:
A. Verification - the process of checking whether the products of a given phase of the software development process fulfill the requirements established on previous phase. Validation answer on the question "Are we building the right product?" and involves comparison against requirements.
B. Validation - the process of checking whether the products of a given phase of the software development process fulfill the requirements established on previous phase. Verification - comparison if a system satisfies requirements.
C. Validation and verification are testing processes.
D. B + C are correct.
Validation - "Are we building the right product?". Verification - "Are we building the product right?".

API testing:
Testing of a set of functions and procedures that allow an access to the features or data of an application/system.
It's type of grey-box testing.
It's testing of GUI.
API testing checks how some software components should interact each other.
API Tesing is Testing of a set of functions and procedures that allow an access to the features or data of an application/system.

Refactoring is:
Changing a piece of code without changing its functionality.
Removing dead and unnecessary code.
Changing a code to do it more understandable
Rewriting a piece of code to do it user friendly.
The definition is changing a piece of code without changing its functionality.

What does external dependency mean?
An external dependency is a situation when an object in system interacts with code under test and you have no control on this.
It's external to an application component like package or library.
It's connection between developed system and a specific application.
None of these.
An external dependency is a situation when an object in system interacts with code under test and you have no control on this.

What is a stub and a mock object and what is the difference between them?
A mock object is a fake object in the system that concludes whether the unit test has passed or failed. A stub is a controllable replacement for an existing dependency in the system. Usually there is one mock and one or several stubs per test.
Stub and mock are fake objects used for testing of a program. There is no big difference between these objects.
A mock is external fake object that can't fail a test. A stub is a piece a code that presents some functionality. a stub may fail a test.
all are correct.
A mock object is a fake object in the system that concludes whether the unit test has passed or failed. A stub is a controllable replacement for an existing dependency in the system. Usually there is one mock and one or several stubs per test. Stub never fails tests.
;
What may create problems by using constructor-based dependency injection technique?
Code under test may require a lot of stubs to work correctly without dependencies.
A code has a lot of classes.
There is only one defined constructor per class.
A default constructor doesn't have parameters.
Code under test may require a lot of stubs to work correctly without dependencies.

What is debugging?
Debugging is a process that includes the following: 1. establishing exact reason and location of the error in the program and 2. fixing this error.
Debugging is a process of fixing failures of system.
Debugging is a process of finding errors with helping tools.
Debugging is scattering a lot of print statements untill we find the error.
Debugging is a 2 phase process that includes the following: 1. establishing exact reason and location of the error in the program and 2. fixing this error.
