Users, stakeholders, development team.
Users, stakeholders, scrum master, management.
Users, management, scrum master, development team.
Users, investors, management, quality assurance team.

Difference between Agile (Ag) and Waterfall (Wat) models in the product deliverability aspect:
Ag - delivered in increasing level of whole development period. Wat - delivered in the end of the development period.
None is correct.
Ag - delivered in the same level of whole development period. Wat - delivered only in the end of the development period.
Ag - delivered in the middle and in the end of the development period. Wat - delivered in the end of the development period.
;
Difference between Agile (Ag) and Waterfall (Wat) models in the Grade of Failure Change (GFC) aspect:
Ag - the higher level in the beginning and reduced in the final stage, Wat - in the increasing level from start to finish.
Ag - GFC is the same level during whole development period, Wat - high in the middle period.
Ag - the low level in the beginning and increasing one in the final stage, Wat - in the reducing level from start to finish.
Ag - the high level in the beginning and almost zero in the final stage, Wat - in the reducing level from start to finish.
;
Difference between Agile (Ag) and Waterfall (Wat) models in the Project Run Rate aspect:
Ag - the same for all period, Wat - higher in the final development period.
None is correct.
Ag - increasing iteratively for all period, Wat - higher in the final development period.
Ag - the same for all period, Wat - higher in the final development period.

What is not ERROR definition:
Error - An incorrect internal state of the system.
Error- A static defect in the software.
Error - The actual 'mistake' in the code.
Error - An incorrect syntax of a code.
;
Difference between software fault and failure is:
Fault is the incorrect state in the system that results from the error. Failure is the deviation from expected behavior observed by the user.
Fault demonstrates the bad state in the system because of an existing error. Failure demonstrate external incorrect state of the system.
Failure is internal incorrect behavior with respect to the requirements. Fault presents external result of the error.
Fault is internal incorrect behavior with respect to the requirements. Failure presents external result of the error.

Which sentence below are correct regarding to Microsoft Fakes framework (MFf)?
MFf helps to isolate the testing code by replacing other parts of the application with fake objects.
MFf helps to test the code you are developing by introducing interfaces to the code of tests.
MFf helps in refactoring the code you are testing by using interfaces.
All are correct.
;
Infeasible test requirements are:
Test requirements for a dead code.
Requirements that may be satisfied.
The situation when no test cases that meet the test requirements of a dead code exist.
All are correct.
;
What is Indirect Input?
Indirect Input are updated parameters of procedures or subroutines.
The situation when the behavior of the SUT is affected by the values returned by another component whose services it uses.
Both answers are correct.
None are Correct.
;
What does it mean - "Methods should have strong cohesion"?
It is the situation when a method should address single task and does it well and also should have clear intent.
It is the situation when a method addresses several tasks in the same time.
It is the situation when a method should perform one or several tasks efficiently.
It is the situation when a method should perform several tasks simultaneously.
;
What is "Test Double"?
It's a test in which we replace the real DOC on a mock one.
It's a test which we created from another one.
It's a test which we created from another one and performed code refactoring.
It's a test in which we replace using of concrete class on using an interface.
;
Which sentence about Decision Table is incorrect?
In Decision Table input conditions are assumed to be independent.
Decision Table represents correlation between input conditions and output actions.
A rule (column) represents correctness of input conditions.
Two rules (columns) can correspond to the same output actions.

What can be the reason of deadlock in debugging by induction process?
Multiple bugs influence to the results of executed tests.
Not enough tests.
Considering oftest cases related to different parts of the program.
All proposed hypotheses are rejected in process of their proving.

An application calculates a water consumption during the considered month. The input consists of two integer values: a month and a year. In the database there exist data from year 2000. What is a number of test cases obtained by using equivalence partition approach?
